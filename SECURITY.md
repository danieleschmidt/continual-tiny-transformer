2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form
4. Submit the report

### 2. Email (Alternative)

Send an email to: **security@[maintainer-domain].com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

## Response Timeline

- **Dependency Scanning**: Weekly automated scans with Dependabot
- **Code Analysis**: CodeQL analysis available via GitHub Actions
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy scans for Docker images
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for releases
- **License Compliance**: Automated license compatibility checks

### Development Security

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security linting with Bandit
- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP guidelines
- **Code Review**: All changes require maintainer review
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected with required checks

### Infrastructure Security

- **SLSA Compliance**: Supply chain security measures
- **Provenance**: Build attestations for releases
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

1. **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Validate all inputs** to prevent injection attacks
3. **Use secure defaults** in configurations
4. **Follow principle of least privilege**
5. **Keep dependencies updated**

### Model Security (ML-Specific)

1. **Validate model inputs** to prevent adversarial attacks
2. **Secure model storage** and transmission
3. **Monitor for model poisoning** during training
4. **Implement input sanitization** for text data
5. **Use trusted datasets** only

### Docker Security

1. **Use minimal base images** (distroless when possible)
2. **Run as non-root user**
3. **Keep images updated**
4. **Scan for vulnerabilities** before deployment
5. **Use multi-stage builds** to reduce attack surface
