# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Continual Tiny Transformer project implements memory-efficient continual learning for transformer models that adds ZERO new parameters per task, based on Amazon Research's breakthrough methodology.

## Core Components

### 1. Model Architecture
- **Base Transformer**: Foundation transformer model
- **Task-Specific Adapters**: Lightweight adaptation mechanisms
- **Memory Management**: Zero-parameter expansion system
- **Continual Learning Engine**: Task sequencing and knowledge retention

### 2. Data Flow

```
Input Data → Preprocessing → Task Router → Base Transformer → Task Adapter → Output
     ↓
Task Memory ← Knowledge Distillation ← Previous Task Knowledge
```

### 3. Memory Efficiency Strategy

- **Parameter Sharing**: Core transformer weights remain frozen across tasks
- **Activation Tuning**: Task-specific adaptation through activation modifications
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Retain previous task knowledge without parameter expansion
- **Elastic Weight Consolidation**: Prevent catastrophic forgetting

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Zero-Parameter Expansion
**Context**: Need to support dozens of tasks without parameter bloat
**Decision**: Implement activation-based adaptation instead of parameter expansion
**Rationale**: Maintains constant memory footprint while preserving task-specific knowledge

### Decision 2: Frozen Base Model
**Context**: Balance between efficiency and adaptability
**Decision**: Keep transformer backbone frozen, adapt only through activation patterns
**Rationale**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting while enabling task specialization

### Decision 3: Task-Aware Routing
**Context**: Need efficient task switching mechanism
**Decision**: Implement lightweight task identification and routing
**Rationale**: Minimal overhead for task switching with maximum performance

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Complexity**: O(1) with respect to number of tasks
- **Computational Overhead**: < 5% per additional task
- **Task Capacity**: Supports 50+ tasks without degradation
- **Knowledge Retention**: > 90% accuracy on previous tasks

## Security Considerations

- Input validation and sanitization
- Model weights protection
- Secure task switching mechanisms
- Data privacy preservation across tasks

## Scalability Architecture

- Horizontal scaling through task distribution
- Vertical scaling through model size optimization
- Memory-efficient batch processing
- Distributed training capabilities
