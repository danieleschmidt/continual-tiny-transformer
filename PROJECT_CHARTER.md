# Project Charter: Continual Tiny Transformer

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Current continual learning approaches for transformer models suffer from catastrophic forgetting and parameter explosion. Each new task typically requires additional parameters, making deployment of multi-task models prohibitively expensive in memory and storage.

### Solution Vision
Develop a memory-efficient continual learning framework for transformers that adds ZERO new parameters per task while maintaining high performance across dozens of sequential tasks.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Zero-parameter continual learning architecture
- Transformer-based model implementations
- Multi-task sequential learning pipelines
- Catastrophic forgetting prevention mechanisms
- Memory efficiency optimization
- Performance benchmarking and evaluation
- Production deployment examples
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials

### Out of Scope
- Non-transformer architectures (CNNs, RNNs)
- Parameter-expansion based continual learning
- Reinforcement learning applications
- Real-time inference optimization (beyond memory efficiency)
- Custom hardware acceleration
