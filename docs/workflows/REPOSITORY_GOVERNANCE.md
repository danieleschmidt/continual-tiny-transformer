# Repository Governance and Advanced SDLC Setup

This document outlines advanced repository governance, branch protection, and operational procedures for mature SDLC practices.

## Branch Protection Rules

Configure these branch protection rules for the `main` branch in repository settings:

### Required Status Checks
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- Required checks:
  - `test` (CI pipeline)
  - `security` (security scans)
  - `build` (package build)
  - `pre-commit.ci` (if using pre-commit.ci)

### Restrictions
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files**
- ✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging**
  - Required approving reviews: **2**
  - ✅ **Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed**
  - ✅ **Require review from CODEOWNERS**
  - ✅ **Require review from administrators**

### Additional Settings
- ✅ **Require signed commits**
- ✅ **Include administrators** (enforce for admins too)
- ✅ **Allow force pushes** (disabled)
- ✅ **Allow deletions** (disabled)

## Code Review Process

### Review Requirements
1. **Automated Checks**: All CI checks must pass
2. **Code Owner Review**: At least one CODEOWNER approval required
3. **Security Review**: For security-sensitive changes
4. **Documentation Review**: For API or user-facing changes

### Review Guidelines
- Focus on correctness, security, and maintainability
- Verify test coverage for new features
- Check for breaking changes and migration needs
- Ensure documentation is updated appropriately

## Release Management

### Semantic Versioning
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, API modifications
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, security patches

### Release Process
1. **Version Bump**: Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. **Changelog**: Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. **Tag Creation**: Create signed git tag `v{version}`
4. **Automated Release**: GitHub Actions builds and publishes
5. **Release Notes**: Auto-generated from changelog

### Release Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass on main branch
- [ ] Security scans show no high/critical issues
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Changelog includes all changes
- [ ] Version follows semantic versioning
- [ ] Release notes are comprehensive
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date

## Security Policies

### Vulnerability Reporting
- **Private Reporting**: Use GitHub Security Advisories
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for acknowledgment
- **Fix Timeline**: 30 days for high/critical issues
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix deployment

### Security Scanning
- **Daily**: Dependency vulnerability scans
- **Weekly**: Full security audit via GitHub Actions
- **Continuous**: CodeQL analysis on all PRs
- **Manual**: Annual third-party security assessment

### Access Control
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all contributors
- **Signed Commits**: Required for all commits to main
- **Token Expiry**: Repository secrets rotated quarterly
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for automation

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Requirements
- Code formatting (Black, isort)
- Linting (Ruff)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Security scanning (Bandit)
- Documentation style (pydocstyle)

### CI/CD Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% line coverage
- **Security Scan**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: No >10% performance regression
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented

### Deployment Gates
- All automated tests pass
- Security approval for releases
- Performance benchmarks within thresholds
- Documentation review completed

## Monitoring and Observability

### Repository Health Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Track coverage trends
- **Security Issues**: Monitor vulnerability counts
- **Dependency Health**: Track outdated dependencies
- **Community Engagement**: Issue/PR response times

### Alerting Configuration
- **Security**: Immediate alerts for high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Build Failures**: Notify maintainers of CI failures
- **Performance**: Alert on significant performance regressions
- **Dependencies**: Weekly digest of available updates

## Compliance Framework

### Development Standards
- **Code Style**: Enforced via pre-commit hooks
- **Documentation**: Required for all public APIs
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests required
- **Security**: Security review for sensitive changes

### Audit Trail
- **Signed Commits**: All commits digitally signed
- **Review Records**: All changes reviewed and approved
- **Access Logs**: GitHub provides comprehensive audit logs
- **Release History**: Complete changelog and release notes

### Legal Compliance
- **License Compatibility**: All dependencies MIT/Apache compatible
- **IP Protection**: Contributor License Agreement consideration
- **Export Control**: Consider ECCN classification if applicable
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for any user data
