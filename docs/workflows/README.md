# Workflow Requirements Overview

## Required GitHub Actions Setup

**Note**: The following workflows require manual setup by repository administrators due to permission requirements.

### Essential Workflows

1. **Continuous Integration** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Run tests on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
   - Code quality checks (black, ruff, type checking)
   - Test coverage reporting

2. **Dependency Updates** (`.github/workflows/dependabot.yml`)
   - Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
   - Security vulnerability scanning

3. **Release Automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - Automated releases on version tags
   - Package building and publishing

### Branch Protection Requirements

- Require PR reviews (minimum 1 reviewer)
- Require status checks (CI tests must pass)
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- Restrict force pushes to main branch

### Repository Settings

- Enable vulnerability alerts
- Enable dependency graph
- Configure merge options (squash commits recommended)

## Manual Setup Required

Repository administrators must manually configure these items as they require elevated permissions.
